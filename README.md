## WorldSkillsShowUK 2019

<!-- import the header image from the design folder  -->

In 2020, I participated in the WorldSkillsShowUK web development competition as a warm-up to practice my skills. The competition provided last yearâ€™s design and design guide just to practice before the actual competition. The design was provided by the WorldSkillsShowUK team.

## Design Guide

The design can be found in the `design` folder.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts

## Project Implementation

During this practice period, I learned about various web development concepts and applied them to my project. I used [these tools](#technologies) to implement the given design.

I also learned about CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, which I applied to my website to create interactive effects. For example, I used the `:hover` pseudo-class on buttons to change their background colour and appearance when the user hovered over them. Furthermore, I used the CSS filter property to improve the visual experience of my website by applying a black and white filter to images in the blog post and then removing it when the user hovers over them to reveal the colours.

### :star: Challenges and Solutions

One of the challenges I faced while implementing the blog section of my project was controlling the behavior of pseudo-classes on parent and child elements. I wanted to create an effect where hovering over the parent element would remove the filter from the child image element and apply a box shadow to it. At the same time, I had to ensure that if the child button was not hovered over, it would remain unchanged. However, if the button hovered over, it would change its background and text color and also apply a box shadow and filter removal to that section.

This was challenging for me to understand and implement, but I was able to overcome it by using CSS `:hover` selectors on the parent element to apply styles to the child elements.

My overall web development skills have improved as a result of this practice experience, which also helped me get ready for the actual competition.
